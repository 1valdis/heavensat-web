## What's this?

An app to answer the questions:
1. **What satellite did I just see?**
2. **How do I see that satellite again? How do I see it in similar conditions, so if it flared it would flare again?**
3. **What interesting stuff is flying over me today?**

For details on development, see Roadmap: https://github.com/1valdis/heavensat-web/issues/1
